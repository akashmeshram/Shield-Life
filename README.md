# Idea

We plan to create an app which would use predictive analytics to generate representations for disaster-affected region.
This information then can be used to allocate resources to prepare for disasters strategically. It will led improve response times while decreasing economic losses for rescuing.

# Brief

During the calamity the most important challange is to scan through severity of the affected area. This information is pivotal for rescue team for they have to make operational decisions. However inefficiency of proper information dipction often led to decrease in disaster relief, which results into worst scenario. One example for this is in case of predicting level of help, areas which can communicate well with the rescue teams are likely to get immediate help, but the remote area that may be worse hit would not get sufficient help from the rescue team due to lack of proper communication and knowledge. It is precisely in this context our app would prove useful. Our app will generate real-time information to help rescue teams to evacuate and save more lives.

# Working of App

1) App would first generate heat map of disaster region. This would be based on severity index of the location.
2) Then by zooming more specific information would generate on map notifying disaster management teams about areas.
3) By using machine learning, actionable insights about people stuck in a particular area will be obtained.
4) Tapping on perticular region on map would generate damage levels of region.
5) By taking into account the geomorphology of region a path to affected point would be generated. 
6) Would help in identifing community resources on the map to aid in recovery.

# Technologies to use

1) Android OS and iOS
2) React native
