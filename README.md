# Idea

We plan to create an app which would use predictive analytics to generate representations for a disaster-affected region.
This information then can be used to allocate resources to prepare for disaster relief strategically. It will help in improving the response time while decreasing economic losses during the rescuing process.

# Brief

During the calamity, the most critical challenge is to scan through the severity of the affected area. This information is pivotal for the rescue team for they have to make operational decisions. However, the inefficiency of proper information depiction often led to decrease in disaster relief, which may result in a heavy loss. One example for this is in case of predicting the level of help, areas which can communicate well with the rescue teams are likely to get immediate help, but the remote area that may be worse hit would not get sufficient help from the rescue team due to lack of proper communication and knowledge. It is precisely in this context our app would prove useful. Our app will generate real-time information based on the severity of the condition of the location to help rescue teams to handle the situation and save more lives.

# Working of App

1) The app would first generate a heat map of the disaster-affected region. This would be based on severity index of the location.
2) Severity index will be based on the level of disaster strike and demographics.
3) Then by zooming, more specific information would generate on the map notifying disaster management teams about significantly affected areas.
4) By using machine learning, actionable insights about people stuck in a particular area will be obtained.
5) Tapping on a specific region on the map would generate damage levels of the region.
6) By tapping on the map, rescue team can extract the coordinates of the region and send it to other teams if required.
7) Would help in identifying community resources on the map to aid in recovery.

# Technologies to use

1) Android OS and iOS
